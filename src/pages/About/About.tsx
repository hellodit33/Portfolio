                                <S.WorkParagraph style={{ justifySelf: 'flex-end' }}>I first worked as a journalist in Swedish media after my journalism studies, between 2017 and 2021. I mostly worked on social and political issues, as well as on culture subjects. I wrote an investigation piece on the culture of honor. Later on I wrote reportages from Algeria during the revolution, and from France during the Yellow Vests protests.</S.WorkParagraph>

                                <S.WorkParagraph style={{ justifySelf: 'flex-end' }}>Nowadays, since November 2022, I work as a Front-end developer at Redmind where I work with website and app development for the client Moveat (React, React Native, TypeScript, NodeJS, Firebase).

                                <S.WorkParagraph style={{ justifySelf: 'flex-start' }}>What I love the most in Front-end development is to make impactful ideas alive, through websites and apps. I love that I can see the results of my job more or less right away.</S.WorkParagraph>
